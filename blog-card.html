        <h3>Electrical inspections and safety checks</h3>
        <p>It is not a mistake to call an electrician from any part of America, but hiring a local 
           electrician will keep you safe after the job. <br>
           Regular electrical inspections and safety checks are key to keeping the electrical system 
           working properly. Be sure to call your local electrician in Los Angeles from time to time to
